# Machine Learning Project

Welcome to my machine learning project repository! This project contains various machine learning algorithms and models that I have implemented as part of my learning journey. Along with the code, I have included some sample CSV datasets to demonstrate how each model works.

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of small machine learning projects. Each project demonstrates the implementation of different machine learning algorithms (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, etc.) using Python. I have also included CSV files with data to train and test the models.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for data visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook (for experimentation)

## Setup

To get started with the project, you'll need to set up the environment by following these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yaash-216/ML.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd ML
   ```

3. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate   # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`
   ```

4. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
   ```

## Usage

To run a specific project:

1. Navigate to the directory of the project:
   ```bash
   cd project_name
   ```

2. If you're using Jupyter Notebook, start it:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

3. Open the notebook and run the code cells to train and test the model.

Alternatively, if you prefer running scripts directly, execute the Python script:
```bash
python project_name.py
```
